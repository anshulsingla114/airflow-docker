"The branch and merge are suitable for project that goes over changes. What would be the best method for the following: I have a software developed for hardware PCB 1. Then PCB2 arrives, which requires few changes, like addresses, features, yet the main software remains.

"I know how to use the git tool in cmd line in linux, so every action you did is known to me, but working with the GUI, where the output is somewhere on the VSC window ... and using this Search, why? Where is the normal menu to git? I do not like how nowadays GUI and UX designer are working on software menus. Microsoft 365 admin consoles and hiding 1 item below an arrow, so I have to click 2 times to show the content of that item, changing everything without any advantage to the admin or developer, and so on ... <br><br>Beside my complains, you did a really great video.",575
