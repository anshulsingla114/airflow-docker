"Wow, this video was absolutely incredible! Thank you for putting so much effort into creating something that brings joy and value to our lives. Keep shining and doing what you love! üåüüòäüëè",185
"I&#39;d never run into your channel before. I&#39;ve been in tech my entire career, and while I&#39;ve bene familiar with Docker in the abstract, I simply haven&#39;t had a pressing need until now. I&#39;d played with it years back, but then hadn&#39;t touched it. This video was the perfect recap to both remind me of what I&#39;d learned before and to fill in a couple of gaps that I hadn&#39;t even known I had. Thanks very much!",432
Thank you very much!,20
This is indeed the best introduction I got to Docker. Thanks for making such a great content.,93
"Thank you so much! This has been the best tutorial I&#39;ve ever experienced. Your explanations were perfect, and you kept me engaged the entire time.",150
"Great Video , Thanks a lot !!",29

best docker intro tutorial ever!!!,34
Amazing tutorial. Thanks for creating the crash course.,55
"Excellent tutorial and introduction !  The way you speak, you explain and you prove things are very enlightening . I&#39;ll keep an eye of your tech activities ...",163
Can I get whole document of docker chets which you have used in middle of video with every code you wrote which explains everything. If I get it would be really easy to revise.,176
interesting,11
"Excellent, very clear!",22
Absolutely amazing learning Docker from this session. Thanks Nana!,66
Wow. Awesome course. üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ,25
You are a great teacher really. Many thanks for your explanation üôè,66
This is the best beginner friendly docker crash course. I have learned a lot from your tutorial. Thanks a lot for sharing this content with us...üëèüëèüëèüëè,149
you have bf ?,13
"Wow, I can&#39;t believe it! I learned Docker in one hour. You are amazing!",75
Wow such an amazingly easy explanation with perfect presentation and images.<br>My first video to watch here and I really appreciate the work!‚ù§,143
It is a great video. Thank you.,31
Thank you,9
Kind of a bad explanation. Problems Docker solve section kind of misleading. Walk-through of an already self guided installation is very strange. Is it really necessary to spend so much time on it?,197
The animation is presented with great content,45
"So good &amp; clear to understand the fundamentals. I have a request, can you have your next video for elastic search?",118
Awesome.,8
I don&#39;t usually like videos especially when only 15% of the way in but I did for this video. Thank you.,107
you saved me so many confusion hours thanks,43
"you are amazing teacher, just awesome !!!",41
"Waouh what an amazing tutorial, 10/10",37
"&quot;What problem docker solves&quot; - there is also yocto where it is easy to build sdk (with all dependencies you need for your application). You build skd, install it, source sdk so then you can compile many times and run your application. I wonder why docker is better than this approach... From google it looks there are some differences but in general both concepts are good, depends what a given person prefers.",420
Thank You Nana <br>Very helpful for beginners,45
Congrats!! Amazing class.,25
Thank you so much for this. This video really helped me understand what docker is coming from a 1990s computer system knowledge.,128
I think women are just more skilled trainers and you are the best of them!,74

"Absolutely slayed the topic! Awesome explanation overall, no wonder your channel grew so fast!",94
Thank you for the video. It was really helpfull. I was stuck in starting and this video did it.,95
"Thank you so much for these tutorials, literally speechless about how great your explanation is and how you covered the workflow and use case, cheers!",150
"This is the best docker crash course I&#39;ve seen so far, I was struggling with all the other videos and with yours I have 0 questions, I loved the part where you created the Dockerfile, you created in a way that it was super clear why you were using some specific commands, you got a new subscriber :)",303

"Thank you Nana, this is the best tutorial for Docker Beginners",62
is it possible to run Power BI in a docker container on m1 Mac?,63
"knowledgable contents are covered in this video  .......<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI""></a>",119
"Thanks for that! <br>(Request: PLEASE don&#39;t slam the keyboard! and/or move your mic out of keyboard range, for some reason my old brain is cross indexing the sound with the equivalent of fingernails on chalkboard :))",220
this is so fantastic... thank you so much!!!,44
"‚Äã @TechWorldwithNana  a very clear and well-designed tutorial, indeed better than many others out there, thanks! A question though: at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg19Z8LL06w&amp;t=3111"">51:51</a> you mention that a base image is mostly a lightweight Linux operating system. But why is an OS needed, if Docker uses the host OS kernel to run images? Let&#39;s say I already have a Linux OS on my machine; why can&#39;t Docker use it instead of the Alpine, and direct system calls from the stuff inside container directly to the kernel of my host Linux OS?",567
Very concise and beautiful presentation that can really help partially blind people like me get on board.,105
Best Docker tutorial by far!!! Thank you!,41
Brilliant Hardwork for us ...No more words to say such course Nana..  complete Docker course learned in just 2 days over weekend ...Thank you üéâ‚ù§,144
"Top-notch tutorial. Thanks, Nana. You&#39;ve earned yourself a new sub",70
"Thank you very much for this tutorial, it helped me a lot!",58
Does she have an OF?,20
I wanted to learn Docker today and this crash course really helped me understand what docker is and how docker works in an hour!<br>The crash course was great in terms of understanding and clarity which a beginner needs!<br>Thanks a lot Nana! Will definetly recommend it to my peers and whoever wants to start learning Docker from scratch.<br>‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•,346
This is the video I&#39;ve been looking for for years. It&#39;s a huge first step and it is for absolute beginners  for sure. Thank you so much for making this amazing work a simple one.,186
Nina you are the best . I have a presentation to my peers on docker . Your tutorial serves the best .,101
"This video is so great! I was trying to understand what Docker is for so long, as I am just starting to do some web dev stuff, the idea of a container and why we need it its hard to understand. This helps so much, thanks!",221
Thank you sir.,14
Great content. Thank you,24
"This is such a great tutorial, everything is so clear and easy to follow",72
My containers do not expose ports...i cannot build the images either. What can I do?,84
Very helpful,12
"Masterpiece! Thanks, Nana <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/8gF1Xp_zK8jk8gSDrI2wCw""></a>",88
"Great job, please continue to put the right questions and after answer them. I think there is the key for you awesome work!",123
"10/10 course, amazing explaination!",35
"Fantastic tutorial, thank you!  One question: in the lifecycle model shown, does the developer build the Dockerfile themselves and commit this as part of the git repo?",167
"It&#39;s a nice tutorial, but my biggest problem with it is that all you do is say how great Docker is. I&#39;d prefer some realism here people. Let&#39;s do a fair analysis of what makes it good and its downsides as well. You sound like the people who make it seem like Agile is the great solution for everything. There are going to be any number of reasons why Docker is not the best solution sometimes, and you need to do things another way. You&#39;re not a very intelligent person if you blindly accept a single option as the only way to do things.",553
Awesome Video!!,15
Helped me a lot for my internship. Thank you very much ‚ù§,56

Impossible not be a subscriber! Thanks a lot!,45
Outstanding presentation. This tutorial really gave me insight into this technology. I am looking forward to adopting docker into my dev process. Awesome job Nana!,163
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg19Z8LL06w&amp;t=995"">16:35</a> You say it&#39;s a lightweight Linux, how can I be sure it has everything I need?  Or is it up to the packager to make sure it has fooQL4.3.9.17 or whatever?<br>Also, what if I&#39;m running an obscure distro of linux for some reason, but I need something  that&#39;s only supplied for RH or Debian, can I run that in a container?",404
"This is great.  and you are an awesome teacher.  You stick with the subject at hand and don&#39;t stray, and you keep it simple.  And even though you have an accent detectable to an American or English audience, your command of the language is impeccable and completely understandable. As we say in the South, &quot;your mama raised you right&quot;.  I really enjoyed this video, and I learned a lot.  It filled in all the holes I had as a beginner.  I&#39;ll be rewatching this and actually working it as I go, but I have one question so far.  Where is the image that the dockerfile creates located?  I suspect I will find out when I do it, but thought I would ask.",666
"The best course about Docker!<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hf90Xv-jHeOR8gSxxrToBA""></a>",91
You are a great teacher; thank you very much for making this video. It was the best hour I‚Äôve ever spent learning something in my life. Every concept was extremely clear and is now firmly embedded in my mind.,208

Imagine taking info from this. Even my 2 year old knows boys from girls.,72
"Thank you so much for an excellent, clearly explained intro to Docker! Seeing your diagrams makes a huge difference in conceptualizing what Docker is actually doing.",165
"I wish you would use the visuals little bit better<br>For example you show the small pups all the time Ava they are great but you keep them up for very short time.  By the time you finish typing the command, the pop up explaining it is already gone .  This would allow taking a single screenshot instead 2 or more for the same item being explained",347
"Thank you very much! This is so clearly explained, with just the right amount of detail.",88
